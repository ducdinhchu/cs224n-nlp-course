Welcome back.
In the previous task, we created a packed bubbles chart
and a treemap.
So, in these tasks, we're going to create dashboards for each
of the charts.
In Tableau, you can create an interactive dashboard that
summarizes several charts, and you can also use a dashboard
to create something similar to a slide, which then
can be added to a story.
For that reason, we're going to create four dashboards.
We're going to begin by adding dashboard to the workbook.
This first dashboard will serve as a cover slide for the story.
So, select 'Image' from the Objects pane
and drop it onto the view.
Then, click on 'Choose Image' and select the image that
is located in the project files folder
Name of the file: Cover.jpg 
Click OK, and the image
will be added to the dashboard.
Next, let's resize the dashboard.
We want this dashboard to have a fixed size
and from the drop down select 'Laptop browser'.
The reason is if we select, for instance, desktop browser,
there will be scroll handles (scroll bars) on the side
and on the bottom of the slide, which is not something that
we would like to have in a story.
So let's pick the size that will allow us to you reduce
the sides and not have to scroll up or down.
Okay, this looks good.
Next, we're going to add one more dashboard.
Second dashboard will contain an image and a chart. So click
on 'Image" and then drag and drop it onto the view.
Click on 'Choose' and from the project files, select 'Side.jpg'.
Right click on the image and select 'Fit image'.
Next, select 'Countries' from the sheets panel and a drop it
to the right off the image.
Next, let's remove the legend, then select the container,
resize it
so it is a little bit wider, and from the Fit setting select
'Entire view'.
Then select the title, right click on the title and click 'Edit
title'. Let's rename it to 'Participants'.
Next step, select the dashboard, click on layout tab, and then
scroll down to find boarder settings.
And select a straight line border.
One last thing.
Let's edit the tool tip.
Let's go back to the chart, click on 'Tooltip', and then instead of
'Winners' Nationality' type in 'Country'.
Feel free to pause the video right now to 
complete this part of the task.
Once you finish with the dashboard, resumed the video.
Good to have you back!
So, next step, we're going to select dashboard #2
and duplicate it.
I'm going to rename it, and next select the chart and removed
from the dashboard.
Then click on Dashboard tab and from the sheets panel
select winners and drop it to the right off the chart.
We're going to remove the legend, resize the container,
and change the fit settings
to 'Entire view'.
Now let's pause and practice.
Add one more dashboard that will contain the remaining charts.
Feel free to change the colors of the charts and add border
to the slide.
When you're done with this part of the task, resume the video
to see my solution.
Good to have you back!
So, here's my solution.
I added two vertical containers and placed charts
into those containers.
Now, let's summarize what we've learned in this task.
In this task, we created dashboards for each slide
of the story.
In the next task, we're going to put the story together
and share it online.
See you in the next task!
