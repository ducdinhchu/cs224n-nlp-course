Hey, hello and welcome to this Chat GPT for Beginners guided project. My name is Danilo Oliveira Vaz. I am a technologist as well as a person who likes to imagine new worlds, as my avatar picture shows here. I am glad that today, we will be working with Chat GPT and Dall-e in order to create a short story accompanied by five unique illustrations that is based on both renowned and experimental sci-fi stories. The main idea for this project is that by the end of it, you will have had a firsthand experiment with using Chat GPT and Dall-e as assistants to your own creative flow. Of course, we'll be thinking about a science fiction story, but hopefully, all of the lessons will be applicable to all other areas as well as to other interaction with these AI assistants that are popping every day. Let's jump right away to the first task where we will navigate Chat GPT user interface, but first, we need to sign up for an Open account, and then we will learn about some effective ways to interact with this tool in the context of a broader conversation on science fiction. It is important to mention that the non-deterministic characteristic of Chat GPT will make it impossible for you to follow along the exact same steps that I will take. Most likely, you will get different results even if you type the same things that I do, so what I would propose for us throughout this project, beginning with this first task, is that we seek to apply key skills that will grant us successful interactions with Chat GPT, Dall-e as well as other AI assistants that are out there. For this first task, the key skills we have are related to the crafting of sharp requests in terms of their specificity, as we will see. I invite you to see me interacting with the model and follow along in your own computer, but be mindful that things will most likely be different for you, and what you should be looking for is applying these key skills as I will be showing them throughout my own interaction. Let's go. Here, I have my browser, and I will navigate to chat.openai.com. It's worth mentioning that Chat GPT and Dall-e are sibling products from the OpenAI initiative, which by itself is owned by Microsoft. Once we go to Chat's website, we are prompted to log in or create an account. You can sign up if you don't have an account; just be mindful that you will need to verify your number. I will log in. This is the initial interface of Chat GPT. In it, we are already shown the capabilities and limitations of it. It's worth just taking a look at them. We have this tab here where we can switch the lighting, we can give feedback, we can upgrade to a paid plan, so we won't have problems with high traffic on the platform, and this might happen while you're taking this course, so be aware of that. With all that being covered, I will begin conversing with it. The main goal in this first conversation will be to exemplify what are ways in which you can interact with the model so as to get the optimal result in terms of time that you will spend talking to it. I will actually be sharing tips towards that end throughout the project. The first one that I have here is that the more specific we are in the request, higher are the chances that we're going to get something to the point. Chat GPT does have a tendency to output long answers when we give it broad questions, so we will try to be drilling down into its specificity as we go with this first conversation. Another tip is to try to be polite with it. That's something I try to do. We can begin by saying, "Hello, Chat GPT." If there are typos or misspellings, they are usually interpreted correctly by the model. "Hello Chat GPT. How are you doing?"

Of course, as you are taking this project, feel free to interact with the model using different terms, or just copying what I'm doing. In this first prompt, I am intentionally asking Chat GPT how it is doing, but in fact, this is not a very optimal prompt because as Chat states here, it doesn't have emotions, so we don't need to spend time with those kinds of questions. At the same time, it's funny that he says that it's happy to help with the sci-fi short story and asked us for the ideas we have so far. I will let it know what I am thinking for this short story. "I would like to reference this sci-fi story on Ursula Le Guin's perspective on science fiction. Do you know anything about it?" Also notice that this has appeared here, and this is our first chat with Chat GPT. "She once said, 'Science fiction is not predictive; it is descriptive.' Le Guin believed that science fiction is a powerful tool for exploring social and political issues as well as the ways in which technology and society interact, and then it goes on." Here, I would say we have a sufficiently concise reply. This comes from my request of being specific on Le Guin's perspective on science fiction, but I want to be even more specific, and I will say, "All right, but in fact, I would like to incorporate Le Guin's Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction. What do you know about it?" It has outputted an answer where it explains the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction in length. You can take a look here to understand what it is all about. Here, in this final paragraph, it tells us how we could incorporate the Carrier Bag Theory into our story, which is nice. It's what I want to do, but notice that I could have gotten here right away; that is, I didn't have to ask any previous information on Ursula Le Guin. I could just have directly asked Chat GPT to help me incorporate this theory into my story. That would have certainly been a more time-efficient approach towards this particular goal. At the same time, it could have been the case that Chat GPT didn't know anything about Ursula Le Guin, so sometimes it makes sense to take the longer route to check points that you think are relevant throughout the way. But for most other cases, you can be as specific as you can get, and you will probably get a desirable answer with Chat GPT. I could have continued this conversation here and go even more to the point of how to incorporate the Carrier Bag Theory and even got an outline or so, but I think that for the purpose of the skills that I wanted to demonstrate in this task, we are done, so I will go back here to our summary slide where we see the main takeaways for this task. The first one being that Chat GPT has a vast database. I was surprised that it knows about Ursula Le Guin's Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction. It's a good indication of its training. Another main takeaway is that the more specific we are, the more we get in terms of the responses. The trade-off is that it may be worth to check if Chat GPT knows the way that we're trying to go before actually going there because if, for instance, it didn't know about Ursula Le Guin, I would have to tell it about it, and that would be a really not optimal approach towards interacting with the two. With this, I finished this task and invite you to the following one where we'll be doing pretty much the same that we've done here, but for Dall-e. See you there.
