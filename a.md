Welcome back.
In the previous task, you learned how to access tableau
and create a new tableau public account.
In this task, you'll learn how to create connect data
to the tableau program to build your first data visualization.
Let's do that now.
So after opening the program, you'll first need to connect
to some data to get started.
Once we open on the left side of your screen, you'll see
a menu that says Connect Under Connect.
We're going to see some different formats of spreadsheets
and text files that we can use to import this data
into tableau.
So different versions of the program allow you to upload
and work with different formats in the free and open source
version of tableaux will only be able to connect to offline
data spreadsheets.
However, if you decide that you'd like to grow into a paid
version of the software, you would then be able to connect
to different dynamic data programs for this project.
Since we're using the open source tableau public, you'll see
that we can use Microsoft Excel text files.
But we can also use Google sheets, and that's under here
under more for our project.
Let's begin by working with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
for our project.
We're using a basic sample, Data said, As a way to model some
of the basic features of the tableau program.
We're going to be using a data set called the Sample
Superstore.
This is good for us to use because it contains information
about products, sales and profits from a fictitious company.
This data is easily relatable across a different number
of business fields.
Let's now find that sheet from uploading it and upload it
from the left side menu of the program.
So what Will Dio is Go under connect.
We're going to connect to a Microsoft Excel sheet on and look
for our data, the sample superstore.
Then just click on that toe, upload it, and now we see
it's connected that easy.
So once we have done this, we're now able to explore our data
and begin working with some of the unique features
of the program.
A couple of things here if we're clicking on the tableau icon
at the very top and left hand side of the screen right here,
this allows us to toggle between the start page and the
authoring work page where we'll be working with our project.
Click there you can just toggle back and forth.
So one of the things that's interesting about tableau
and the main pages that we can look at and discover
some other data files.
So if we look under discover on the right hand side,
we'll see that you can look at some, um, tutorial videos
and introduction to the interface that we're working with.
We can look at some information about different chart types.
We can look and review some mawr additional how to videos,
and we can also look at some samples of what other people
have done with tableau under viz of the day here, you'll see
some samples of what members of the tableau community
might post as an example of a good data visualization.
Tableau refers to these as visits, so you'll see viz
of the day, and those will change.
Once you're familiar with these features and build your first
project, I suggest that you come back to this pain
and explore a little bit more about what's possible
Within the tableau public desktop.
However, let's toggle back to our data, and now
that we have connected our data to the our spreadsheet, we're
ready to move forward.
So in this task, you learned about connecting the spreadsheet
data to tableau.
In the next task, you learn about how to manipulate
the sample data to change the appearance of the resulting
dashboard and thus personalizing your resulting graph.
