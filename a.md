Hi. Welcome to the scores on Visualizing City by trips with
tableau Tableau is a Data Analytics platform used typically
for business.
Intelligence.
Tableau helps us visualize, analyze and ultimately get
insights from data.
These insights can then be used for decision making.
In this course, we're going to create a visualization in
tableau public.
This will be for Citi bike rides in February 2018.
This data includes information on all the trips that city by
customers and subscribers have taken in in the month of
February 2018.
So we will create a single dashboard comprising of six sheets,
and this will ultimately look something like this.
In case you don't see this already open on your rhyme virtual
machine.
Just go to chrome and it should be there, right.
As you can see, we will create a bunch of these different
sheets.
We'll have most popular start stations.
Most popular stop stations, average trip duration for user
type, most popular start stations with most common end
stations, the stop time and average start time for different
types of users.
Now, Tableau has a bunch of different versions, but the one
that we are using is available for free.
This version is called Tableau Public and has most of the
features that other versions have, with the main limitation
being that your work cannot remain private if you wish to
save it.
So if you're saving it, you must publish it to tap the public
platform and you'll get a page similar to this one.
And when you start your virtual machine in rhyme, you should
see this already loaded up this visualization, and you should
also see tableau already loaded.
So this is the start page for tableau Now.
The data set that we're using is taken from Citi bike, nyc
dot com and let's go to the next chapter and import the data
set.
