Hi everyone. In this guided project, customer service with Python, build a chatbot using chatGPT. In this 16 minutes guided project, I'll be your instructor Mo Rebaie with more than eight years experience as an AI mentor and working as a lead learning developer at Workera and I'm an active community guide at Coursera Community. On this project, you will learn how to build and customize an AI powered chatbot using Python and chatGPT API. You will implement the efficient and responsive customer service solutions for various business scenarios. We have three learning objectives for this guided project. First, we will use Python to integrate the ChatGPT API for Chatbot functionality. Then we will design a conversation flow to handle the frequently asked questions in customer service scenarios. At last, we will build and test a customer service chatbot. Now for the project scenario, you are an AI developer at a dynamic e-commerce company and you want to enhance the customer server. You have to enhance the customer service efficiency through technology. This project involves leveraging Python and chatGPT in order to develop the AI chatbot that is designed to handle customer inquiries about products, shipping, returns, support, and providing quick and accurate responses. The aim is to improve the customer experience by offering instant support, reducing wait times, and ensuring consistent quality in responses. I can't wait to start this project, see you on the first task.
