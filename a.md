Welcome to the last and the final task of our guided project. In this task, we will build a customized chatbot and chat with it. We will personalize the chatbot further to suit specific e-commerce scenarios and engage in advanced interactions. As you know that in the previous task,

we have initiated a chatbot conversation, but it was not customized. Let's see how we can customize it in this task. Returning back to the Google Colab file, this is the final code block where we import the OpenAI library. Then we can start the chatbot conversation with a welcome message, and then we can initialize the conversation with a system message to set the context for ChatGPT. This system message is very important for the Model Y because if you imagine that you are directly chatting with ChatGPT, and when you say or give an instruction prompt to the model that you are an X, means that the model should act as if it has the X capabilities. Here in the system message, you are asking the model or you are telling the model that you are a customer service AI knowledgeable about ebooks. This is the most important prompt, which is the system prompt. Feel free to change the ebooks, a topic here, and add any other service or domain. Now, we have to continuously interact with the model. There should be an interaction, a continuous interaction between the user and the model, as you can see here.

In this piece of code, we are checking if the user wants to end the conversation. If the user wants to end the conversation, the user can say buy or quit and then the model will generate this response, "Thank you for using our chatbot. Have a great day." Here, the user input to prompt, it's an iterative process, and then sending the user input and the current prompt to ChatGPT API and receiving the response using the same model on reinforcement learning, with human feedback, with the same temperature to ensure that the model has a sense of creativity and the responses. We are using maximum tokens of 150 because, actually, we don't need more tokens in the output. Now, this line of code for extracting and displaying the models response with skipping empty responses and then checking if the user's query is off topic, which is also important. Let's say here we are saying if ebook or book are not in the user input, then the model will print, " I'm sorry, I specialize in ebooks." Here you can play with the code and change the words or add more words even to customize it better. The key words that I used because the model that I want is a customer service, AI knowledgeable about ebooks, that's why I used that the users should include the request prompts, the words ebook or book. Great. Then we are updating the prompt with the next iteration. Let's now run this cell, so running this code block. As you can see, the chat window here, let's say, hi. The model responded back. Do you know about AWS? "I'm only knowledgeable about ebooks." Because we asked the model about AWS.

Do you know about ebooks? I'm just asking basic questions, but you are ask more advanced questions. "Yes, I'm very knowledgeable about ebooks. What kind of questions do you have about ebooks?" Let's now try to ask specific questions. For example, what type of ebooks can you help me with?

"I can help you with any type of ebook."

Suggest me an ebook in science fiction, for example. Great. The model is now suggesting a very specific book about science fiction. Let's say another question. How long reading time will take reading this book?

The model also responding perfectly. "This book is approximately 200 pages long and takes approximately 6-8 hours to read." Wow, this is really perfect. Thank you. "You're welcome.

Thank you for using our chatbot. Have a great day." I really enjoyed it. It's really great. Don't forget that you can change the system prompt where you can direct the model to be specialized or to act as if it's specialized in other domains. That's it for this task. I would highly recommend you to use this Colab file while you are building your customized AI powered chatbots using ChatGPT APIs. Thank you so much. I really enjoyed being your instructor on this guided project. Kindly don't forget to take the graded quiz and the ungraded survey at the end of the guided project. Also, feel free to rate the project because your thoughts are valuable.
