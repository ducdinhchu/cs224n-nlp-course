Welcome back in this chapter, we're going to take a look
at the distribution of most common end stations with the most
popular start stations.
So let's create a new work cheap, and we're looking at most
popular start stations so that dimension already exists
for a start stations.
We just need to drag and drop it in columns, and then all we
really need to do is drag and drop the number of records
on Rose.
Now this will display all the stations that we have,
but we are looking at only the most popular ones.
So let's create a filter.
We'll drag and drop the start station names on the filter
and go to condition by field Number of records.
Some should be greater than equal to 5000.
Now we have these six starts stations, which have records
more than 65,000 records.
Great, and we also want to take a look at the distribution
of the most common end stations for these popular start
stations.
So let's drag and drop the end station name on color.
Now, W will ask you if you want to add all the entries, all
the members here and the recommended Maximum for this shelf
is 20. So we actually only want to take a look at the most
common ones May be like the most common 45 once.
So we'll click on filter and then we'll add in the ladder
filter condition by field number of records some greater
than equal to 5000.
Great. Now you will see a legend is added to this plot where
you have the end station names, the different colors.
And of course, you have the start station name with their
number of records here.
So, for example, if you look at this entry right here, this
is showing us and station uh, name a start station name
and the number of records for this start station which ends
in the end station.
Dinner it by the scholar.
Great. Let's also write the title for this plot.
Most popular start inspections and also renamed the sheep.
So most well, making this contact start sections.
He only have seen these in the start station plot here
plotted on the map.
Great. So now we have the distribution of the common
and stations for the most popular star stations.
Now, in the next chapter, we are going to take a look at the,
uh, start time and stop time for our customers as well
as subscribers.
