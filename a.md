Welcome back.
This is the first task of the 'Create a Story in Tableau Public'
guided project.
In this task, you will learn how to connect a data source
and create line charts.
Tableau is a robust business intelligence platform
that turns any kind of data from almost any system
into actionable insights.
While most of the Tableau products are scalable and require
a role-based licensing, Tableau Public is a data
visualization platform for data enthusiasts like you,
and it is free.
So let's jump right into it.
Launch Tableau Public from your Rhyme virtual desktop.
Next, we're going to download the data set. So click
on Simple data sets in the Discover panel on the right
and you will be redirected
to Tableau Public resources page.
Once the page is loaded, scroll down and find the data set
for the Tour de France statistics.
Click on the file and download it.
Once I have the file, I'm going back to Tableau Public
and then select Microsoft Exel
from the Connect panel on the left, and select
the folder where you just downloaded 
the file and connect to that file. 
Alright. Next, let's use the data interpreter to clean up the data set.
And, next, click on had a new sheet and we're going
to start building the line charts.
Feel free to pause the video right now to 
complete this part of the task.
Once you connected to the data set, resumed the video.
Alright, now we're going to create our first line chart.
This line chart will show the number of race stages
for each year the race took place.
So, select 'year' from the tables and drop it into the columns
shelf, and then select 'number of stages' and drop it onto the
rows. Now let's add a trend line.
Click on the chart and then select 'trend lines' then 'show trend lines'.
And one more thing -
we're going to add drop lines to the chart.
So, right click on the chart, select 'drop lines' and then
'show drop lines'.
Next, right click on the chart again.
Select drop lines and this time
choose 'edit drop lines'. From the 'drop when' select 'only when
selected' and leave 'drop to' and 'labels', as is. Click OK.
Now, when you hover over the chart and click on a point
on the chart, it will show drop lines to the year
and to the number of stages.
Now, let's practice. Pause the video and create a line chart that
shows the race distance for each year the race took place.
Once you're done with it, continue with the video to see my
solution.
Good to have you back.
So here is my solution.
I created the chart and added drop lines.
Now what I want to do is add forecast and the trend line
to the chart.
So switch to analytics tab and then select 'forecast'
from the model panel.
And, drop it onto the view. Next select 'trend line'
and drop it onto the view.
One last thing.
right click on the chart, select 'forecast' then 'forecast options'
and in forecast model options
change it from automatic to automatic without seasonality.
Click OK, and we're done.
Great work so far!
Now, let's summarize.
In this task, we learned how to connect a data source,
cleanup data using the data interpreter, and created two line
charts with drop lines, trend lines and forecast cone.
In the next task will pick up where we left off and we
will build a packed bubble chart.
See you in the next task!
