Hi, and welcome to this project on ChatGPT, alongside Microsoft Excel. This project will focus on the ways in which you can use ChatGPT to essentially make your life easier in Excel and this can be through a variety of different means. Through standardizing data, through cleaning up data, through generating dummy data to bring into your Excel spreadsheets and much more. But before we dive in, let me introduce myself. My name is Jan Demiralp. I used to be a strategy consultant for a multinational consulting firm where I spent a lot of time in Excel spreadsheets. During my five years there I developed a specialism in emerging technologies, in particular, artificial intelligence. Then off the back of that, I now create courses through Coursera, specializing in AI, and I have published another course on ChatGPT for beginners, focusing on using AI for market research. I'm also an entrepreneur and have my own self-growth academy called Inner Compass, which aims to help people live more aligned and intentional lives through creating a community around self-exploration and life design. Without further ado, let's dive in to the course content. What is the focus of this project? Well, the intention is for you to feel comfortable using ChatGPT alongside Excel to help you standardize, extract, classify, and generate data to use within your Excel spreadsheets. The learning objectives are for you to use ChatGPT to write complex formulas to aid with common tasks, to use ChatGPT to generate dummy data, to populate data tables, as well as working within ChatGPT to standardized data and conducting sentiment analysis to classify that data. All of this will become clearer as we dive into the exercises. Here's a scenario to help ground what we're doing into the day-to-day business world. Imagine that you've just started as a business analyst and you are required to get better at Excel rather quickly. The learning curve is pretty steep and your colleagues, they don't have that much time to mentor you one-to-one. Looking for solutions, you turn to ChatGPT as a way to boost your Excel productivity and improve your skills. In this first task, we're going to focus on getting set up both in ChatGPT and within your Excel template. Open up a browser of your choice, go to Google or go to the top search bar and type in ChatGPT OpenAI. Here we have the top results. ChatGPT OpenAI, chat.openai.com. We're going to click on here. This brings us to the login page. If you have an account already, then you can go and hit the login button here. If you don't have an account, then go to the sign-up button here.

Here you'll be prompted to create an account. You can do this easily with Google, or you can do it manually by entering your email address here.

I already have an account, so I'm going to go back and I'm going to hit log in, and I'm going to continue with Google.

Now, here we have the ChatGPT interface. On the left-hand side here you can see that I have all my previous chats which I have been interacting with ChatGPT saved in this slide panel. I have the ability to create a new chat by clicking this button up here on the top-left, and I can also create a new chat by just typing something into this box at the bottom here. Before we dive into using ChatGPT, I'm going to go through the interface very quickly. At the top here we have a toggle which allows us to switch between the two underlying models which ChatGPT uses, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. GPT-4 being the more powerful model. Since you only have GPT-3.5, that's the model we're going to be using. The ChatGPT is a generative large language model, meaning that the answers that it produces are going to be unique every time. Let's say I type a prompt in the bottom here asking a question, if it is a open ended question, then most likely the answer that it generates for me is going to be different from the one it generates for you. If that's the case, when you're following along there are different answers between what you have and what I have on the screen, then know that's completely okay. Also keep in mind that there are some limitations when it comes to using ChatGPT. There are biases within the answers which come from the data-sets which have been used to train ChatGPT. However, I won't go too much into this. The outputs we'll be getting from ChatGPT in this course are going to be more technical in nature since we're asking ChatGPT to support us in producing Excel formulas and manipulating and transforming data for us. Though if you'd like to learn more about using ChatGPT for let's say market research, then I suggest you check out my course on ChatGPT for beginners using AI for market research, and in that I go into more in-depth around some of the considerations you need to have top of mind when using ChatGPT in a more qualitative sense. Now that you're set up in ChatGPT, I also want to make sure that you have the Excel workbook currently open. In the reading material ahead of this video, there's a link for you to open and within it, you should have gained access to this workbook. If you haven't done so, then there'll also be a link at the bottom of this video for you to click and download an Excel file for you to open. Once you open that Excel file you should be greeted with a table of contents with each line within this table of contents containing an exercise linking to a task within this course. We'll be working through each one of these over the subsequent videos. To summarize, we have set ourselves up within ChatGPT and within our Excel workbook. A couple of points to note, ChatGPT is a generative large language model, LLM for short, and the way you interact with an LLM is through a concept called prompting or priming. Be mindful of bias when using ChatGPT or similar large language models. Be mindful that large language models can hallucinate answers, meaning that you should always be careful when receiving answers from large language models and making sure that you check them. Finally, be careful not to paste any sensitive company data from your work laptops into ChatGPT since data will be stored for training purposes within ChatGPT. In the next task, we'll be looking at standardizing dates which have varying formats with the help of ChatGPT
