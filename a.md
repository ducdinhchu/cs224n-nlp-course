Hello and welcome to how to create an interactive resume
in Tableau.
My name is carmen and I'm a digital marketing and business
intelligence consultant with 17 years of experience
in digital marketing.
Data and business analytics today.
I'm excited to show you one of my favorite tools and how it
can help you show your resume in a unique and impressive way.
The tool I'm talking about is Tableau.
Tableau is a powerful data visualization software program.
It is one of the leading tools for turning numbers
into learning and data into insights about companies
departments and research.
It is commonly used to create charts, graphs and other data
visualization displays.
You may not have thought of it as a way to display your
resume.
I have to admit it wasn't the first program I thought
of for this purpose but if you are in the data and analytics
field, showing your strength with data visualizations
by creating your resume in Tableau showcases your strength
and prowess with this tool.
By creating a well designed yet a typical visualization.
Before we start to work on your interactive resume,
let's take a look at some to get a sense of what is possible
in Tableau here at public dot Tableau dot com.
We will first click up here on discover, then click over here
in the magnifying glass and we're going to type in resume.
What we see here are lots of different kinds of resumes.
It is impressive to see the many different color images
and layout choices that can be made.
Let's take a look at this one.
This resume by Tristan Gui even I hope I'm saying that right
is simple, clean and shows his personality.
There's another really nice one.
Yeah, This one is a bit longer and has some vertical scroll
available.
I really like the color and the layouts of this one.
But you should note that the owner of this Lindsay is
a Tableau zen master so she has some top notch tableau skills
in this course.
I can't teach you to be a zen master but you will learn
the foundational skills, you need to get to something
this advanced.
Eventually the resume you will learn to create will look
something like this first.
Let's get you set up with an account on Tableau.
If you already have an account you can skip the rest of this
and move on to task too.
On the home screen here you will see two options that both
seem to be the solutions to our account needs.
Let me explain the difference.
Downloading the app Will install a modified version, not
identical to the licensed one.
Um With many of the basic Tableau functions to your device
clicking sign up, we'll take you through the process
of creating a public profile on Tableau.
If you download the software without creating an account you
can still use many of the Tableau features on your own data
set. However you won't be able to print or use the data sets
in programs outside of Tableau such as power points.
If you want to be able to access data sets, visits, print
your visits and use other parts of Tableau, you have
to create a public profile to download the app, click
download and then follow the prompts on your computer
to install the software.
Once complete, the software can be accessed
through the applications folder.
Creating an account is easy.
You're gonna come up here, click sign up on the next screen.
You'll need to enter your name, email and password.
Some people find entering their real names to be useful as it
can help build credibility within the data science community.
However, you should consider the risks of disclosing your
full name.
Once this is complete, click create my profile.
All done.
On the next step, we will begin to translate your doc style
resume into a data resume.
