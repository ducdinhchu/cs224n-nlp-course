Hello, welcome to the project ChatGPT Playground for Beginners, An Intro to the World of AI. My name is Rudi, I'll be an instructor today, I'm a Full Stack Developer and DevOps engineer. And today we're going to be building an AI-powered chat interface, which is going to be simulating a virtual family doctor using the ChatGPT playground. Through this, we're going to be examining key operational principles of the backend of ChatGPT and we're going to learn how to manage system and user level inputs as well as parameters to be able to customize AI responses more effectively. We have three core learning objectives for our project today, the first one is that we want to actually understand the fundamental operations of using the ChatGPT, especially on the back end. We want to be experimenting with key parameters such as temperature, max, tokens, top p, frequency penalty and presence penalty in order to actually customize the output style of our responses. We'll also manipulate system-level as well as user-level roles to be able to effectively guide AI responses. And to do all this, we're going to be working around a project scenario where your role is that you're an AI engineer at a healthcare startup. And essentially we've got an overwhelming volume of routine patient queries within our surgery which are related to general health advice. You've been asked, in order to actually alleviate a lot of this workload, to build an AI chat interface that simulates a caring virtual family doctor using the OpenAI's ChatGPT playground. This could be useful for you if you're a software engineer and you're working at the bleeding edge of modern technology. And perhaps want to go into working with other businesses and creating solutions such as chatbots using AI technology to help their businesses become more efficient. In order to complete this project effectively, you'll need a browser, I recommend Chrome, and you'll also need a credit card to use tokens to be able to interact with the interface. The cost of the tokens are not significant, we're talking cents rather than dollars. And when you actually sign up, if you haven't used the GPT playground before, free tokens may be available for you within a trial period. And so without further ado, let's go ahead and get started. If you haven't used rhyme before with the video controls, you're encouraged to pause the video to give yourself time to actually go ahead and practice some of the things that we're actually talking about in the project within your own environment. Feel free to go backwards and forwards through the tasks as well as rewinding things in order to be able to give yourself that time to actually fully practice the concepts that we're actually learning today. So without further ado, let's go ahead and get started, shall we? And so for our first task, we're going to be working on an introduction to ChatGPT, as well as understanding how it works. We have two main objectives here, the first one is to actually understand the general concept of AI as well as the basic working mechanism of ChatGPT. And secondly, we're going to go ahead and set up our playground and write our first simple prompt to the ChatGPT API. Let's go ahead and get started. And so for our first objective, just actually understanding what AI actually is, in particular, natural language processing. First, we have to start off with what exactly is AI? AI, as you will know, stands for Artificial Intelligence, and this refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, especially computer systems. It is obviously a broad field, but for our purposes, we're going to be focusing on the natural language processing part of AI. For short, we call it NLP. NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to be able to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human language in a way that is valuable to us. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, which is designed to generate human-like text based on the input that it's given. It's a really high-level look, but we want to actually see this in action. So let's jump on over to the GPT playground. And so I want you to open up a new browser inside your browser, we're just going to simply search for GPT playground. When we do that, we're going to see a number of options, the one we're looking for is Platform Openai.com. Okay, so we can go on over to any link here, and then the first thing we're actually going to do is actually to sign up, so we're going to click on sign up here. You can sign up either with an email address or you can do it with one of your accounts. For me, I'm actually going to log in with my Google account. Now, once you've actually logged into ChatGPT here, we're going to see an option up here called Playground. And so if I click into this box here and I type here once upon a time, and then go ahead and hit submit here, this is where we may have to actually set up billing for you. For you you may actually see that this is actually going to give you some free tokens, but it may give you this usage limit alert here. So if that happens, let's go on over to the billing settings here and what you're going to need to do here you may have a free trial here still with some tokens remaining on your account. If that's not giving you that option, we can go ahead and set up a paid account here and click I'm an individual, and go ahead and put your card details in here. Once that's actually done, you should be able to see this screen here on Billing overview just to see that you'll be billed at the end of each calendar month for usage during that month. If we go in here into usage limits, you kind of see how much your current usage actually is, what your approved usage limit is as well. And just to be on the safe side, you can go ahead and set limits here, hard limits and soft limits to actually create a threshold after which subsequent requests will be rejected. Let's go on over to the playground. Now, if you just click on the link here, playground. And let's try our prompt once again, once upon a time and hit Submit, We can see that ChatGPT is actually generating what it feels is a good response to that prompt. So it's taking that prompt and it's deciding what is logically likely to actually come next. So go ahead and read it. Nice little story. And so essentially, it's taking what we input, breaking it down into tokens, figuring out what should come next, and then providing us with human-readable output. And now you can actually see the magic of ChatGPT. Okay, so very well done, we've actually understood the general concept of AI and understand the basic working mechanism of ChatGPT. We've gone ahead and set up our playground and written our first simple prompt. In our next task, we're going to be diving into more detail about tokens and how they influence the cost of using ChatGPT or the ChatGPT API. So look forward to seeing you there.
