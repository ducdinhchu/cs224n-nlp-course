Welcome to the first task of our guided project. In this task we will import the libraries and define the OpenAI API key. So we will set up the coding environment by importing necessary Python libraries and configuring the OpenAI API key for access. So the task objective is to use Python to integrate the ChatGPT API for chatbot functionality. And we should understand the library importation in Python and learn how to configure API keys securely and grasp the initial setup for AI applications, specifically an AI-powered chatbot.

Great. So before we start, you will find this Google Colab file titled chatbot GPT in the reading section of this guided project. You have to access it on your Google Colab account and it's free to access and to use. And you can follow with me step by step in understanding the code blocks and implementing the necessary variables.

So first of all, we have to install the OpenAI library, because as you know that we want to use the chat GPT chatting in this Google Colab file. So we have to get the OpenAI library.

Okay, great. So first of all we have to import the libraries and define the OpenAI API key. In order to do so, we have to install the OpenAI library, why? Because if we want to access ChatGPT, we have to use the OpenAI library in this Google Colab file.

In order to be able to call the API key. So first of all we have to install this library and you might need only to install the OpenAI library. Recently, the pip install OpenAI and pip install OpenAI upgrade will install a version of 1.x of the OpenAI Python library. Upgrading from the version 0.28 to the version 1.x, so it's really a breaking change. But if you face any problems or any issues, you have to run this line of code. Installing OpenAI 0.28.

Great, now after installing the library, we have to import it. So we import the library and then we have to go to the OpenAI platform and get our API key.

So make sure to get your API key from the official OpenAI API page in order to paste it here. Because we will be using the API key. And you need to get your own API key because this is my own API key that I have to use personally and it might not work for you. So let's execute this code block. As you can see, now that we have imported the needed libraries and got our API key. Feel free to pause the video and to get the API key, paste it here and execute the code and execute the code and then prepare yourself to the next task where we want to chat with ChatGPT using the API key. See you on the next task.
