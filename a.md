Welcome back.
In the previous task, you learned about connecting a data set
to tableau using a Sample Excel data sheet.
In this task, you'll learn about using a feature on tableau
public to manipulate the data and create a unique visual
graphic chart.
Before we do much more, let's tour this part of the screen.
On the left hand side, you'll see our data items, including
both dimensions and measures thes air the building blocks
of our project.
If we go down to sheet on the bottom menu, we can see
these items.
Dimensions are items that are categorical.
Data measures are typically numerical data.
In tableau, you'll see that these air shown in different
colors, the blue items are discreet and green items are
continuous.
This will be important to know is we move forward within our
project because Tableau provides for some building features.
That gives us hints and help us build different chart styles.
We also see on our screen shelves and Mark's cards
with multiple shelves, thes cards and shelves is tableau
calls thumb.
Allow us to change the color, text and line size of the chart
output when we're ready to change the way that everything
looks. Tableau was designed as a drag and drop program in her
face. This means that we can drag measures and dimensions
listed on the side bar here onto the stage, and they will
then appear as's columns or rows in our data visualization
output.
We can also change the color or size of these features
by dragging these measures into the card with that descriptor.
So when we open our file, we're at the point where we
can define the data that we want to view on our sheet
to get started.
We're going to drag information about sales orders here
across the pain and into rose at the top.
Now we're also going to drag, order, date or order here
into our columns.
That creates a simple line chart, and that's our first data
visualization.
But we're not done yet.
We still need to add some interaction.
Yeah, To do this, we're going to need toe add a second sheet
by going to the bottom menu and adding a new worksheet.
In this worksheet, we can add category to our columns
and possibly quantity to our rose.
So now we've created a second sheet and a second graph.
If we hover over the items on the graft, you can see
some information about what that graph is telling us.
Now. Let's bring these two together the bottom of the screen.
We're going to find Dashboard one to create a new dashboard.
Now, when we do that, we see that we've brought up a new view,
and on that we can see two different tabs.
We'll see one for dashboard and one for layout, where we can
edit some of the size and shape of the layout.
But let's go to the tab for dashboard first.
And what we simply dio is create the dashboard by dragging
over each of the charts that we've already created.
So there is sheet one and sheet to, and what we'll see is
that it appears together side by side.
So if we look at this, we can see the first sheet that we
created and the graph that resulted next to the second sheet
that we created and the graph that resulted there.
Next, we wanna look at the filtering of information and
creates, um, interaction between these two items.
Now, to do this, we're going thio hover over the filter icon
on sheet, too, and we're going to use this sheet as a filter
for the first sheet.
So what you'll see then is as we hover over the far for the
sheet to for furniture, you'll see that the sheet and the
graph her sheet one will change.
It will interact from sheet 12 sheet, too, so these two
graphs now work together.
As we click on the second bar on sheet, too, we can see the
graph resulting for the data in sheet.
One is only going to reflect the sheet that the data for
office supplies if we hover over the third item again, our
sheet one changes and shows only the information related to
the category technology.
So what we've done here is created three different graphs on
sheet, one that relate to the three different items that
Aaron sheet, too.
So this creates an interaction between these two data graphs.
So in this task, you learned how to manipulate the data in
tableau.
Public desktop in the next task will learn about using the
show me tool to quickly and easily view different formats for
these charts, and to determine which charts style works best
for your data.
