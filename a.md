Welcome back in this chapter.
We are going to take a look at the behavior of our customers
and subscribers, uh, with respect to the starting and ending
time of their trips on city bikes.
So let's create a new worksheet, and we're looking
at the start time.
So let's add that to our column, and we are looking
at the total records that we have for those start times.
So right now the column is by default.
It's showing just the year.
So what we want to do is select per hour, and that will give
us the A number of records for different hours during the day.
And you can see that at eight AM the records are the highest,
and then we have at 17, which is 5 p.m. And 6 18, which is
six PM These are also pretty high.
Great. Now we want to use our user type and see how this data
might differ for our customers and for subscribers.
So let's drag and drop this on color, and it will give us
a legend here for customer and subscriber, two different user
doubts that we have and the data here.
So in this part, you can see that your subscribers are very
active.
They're starting the trips at eight AM and they're starting
the trips at 5 p.m. And 6 p.m.
But your customers actually use the city bikes mostly
during the day in between those beats that we have.
So around two PM one PM and so on.
Great. So this is what are the title for this?
This is the start times for our different user types.
And let's actually duplicate this.
It's a stark time.
Duplicate this and create any times.
And we need to change the scholars from start time.
Two our stock time.
So when our crib stops and again, we need to change it
from here to power.
Okay, great.
So now our trips normally stop at eight.
At least these are the most common times at eight AM and then
at 6 p.m. And Cyprien.
But this is for subscribers.
For our customers, the common, um, hours of the day are
3 p.m. or maybe one bm and 2 p.m. And so on.
Great. So we understand a bit of behavior of our customers
and subscribers, and now that we have all the plots that
we wanted to create all the sheets that we wanted to create.
We are going to create one dashboard visualization with all
of them.
Let's do that in the next chapter.
