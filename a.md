Welcome back before we start to create a plot for our most
popular start stations.
Let's double click on this title and change this to most
popular and extinctions.
And I am a land that's in the center.
Great. You know, we have a title for this block.
We will also double click on where it says Sheep
one and let's call it end stations.
All right, so next up, we're going to create start stations,
applaud for start stations, which are most popular.
So let's right click on end stations and duplicate this.
Well, I changed the name change the title, and we will also,
of course, change the data.
So instead of any station attitude, click on it.
Delete this.
We will have start station attitude.
And again, we're not looking at average values.
We're looking at them individually, dimensions and instead
off end station longitude.
We should have start station launched here.
All right, let's zoom out a little bit.
So these are the most popular stations from where our city
bike trips start.
All right, so that was pretty simple to do.
We had already done most of the work in the previous chapter.
Correct.
Now let's take a look at the average duration of our trips.
Let's do that in the next chapter.
