Welcome to the next task of our guided project. In the previous task, we imported the OpenAI library and we got our API key. In this task, we will chat with ChatGPT using the API key to make sure that we have successfully accessed the ChatGPT

before we start building our AI Chatbot. We will implement basic communication with a ChatGPT model using the API key sending and receiving messages from the model. The task objective now is to use Python to integrate the ChatGPT API for Chatbot functionality. We have to establish the API connectivity in Python, send requests to and interpret responses from ChatGPT and also explore basic functionalities of the ChatGPT model.

Great. Going back to our Collab file, here is Desk 2 where we have to chat with the ChatGPT using the API key to make sure we can access the model. First of all, you can see here the function to send a message to ChatGPT and get a response. The function includes the engine where you can use a different engine if needed and this default engine is trained with supervised fine tuning instead of reinforcement learning. We define also the prompt, which is the message itself. Then we specify the maximum token limit up to 50 and we can adjust this based on our desired response length. Because we are dealing with a customer service Chatbot, we don't need more than 50 tokens, but feel free to adjust the number up to 100 for example. But you will see that we will not need a lot of lengthy output response. Let's now execute this cell. As you can see here, we can start chatting with the model as if we are chatting directly with ChatGPT. We can just start chatting with the model to make sure everything is all set. Hey there. How are you today? I'm doing well. How about you? Let's ask about, do you help in customer service. Yes, I can help. Let's say,

can I ask you about specific products or services? Yes, you can ask me anything. Let's ask the model to give us more specific output. Great. Let's say. Tell me about the AWS Core AI services. Now we are asking about the AWS services. Here is the response of the model. AWS offers a variety of AI services, including SageMaker, polly, lex, rekognition, and other tools and services. As you can see here, this chat window is same as as if you are chatting directly with ChatGPT.

Which means that the API access is working perfectly fine. Feel free to keep chatting with the model for more fun. For now, we have finished this task. In the upcoming task, we will set up the conversation with the ChatGPT model. We will define the Chatbot conversation function. See you on the next task.
