Welcome back in the previous video.
You learned how to get started on Tableau and how to create
an account.
In this video.
We will transform atop a document style resume into a data
style spreadsheet.
Let's begin as we get started.
I wanted to suggest a few things you will want handy as we
move forward.
I mentioned your resume but you may also find having your
linkedin profile handy could be useful.
Much of this.
Interactive resume will depend on dates, so having the start
and end dates for different skills courses and certifications
you have will save you some time.
You will need access to a spreadsheet.
We will not be doing any calculations or creating
visualizations in them.
So the important thing will be compatibility compatibility
with Tableau rather than the specific program itself.
The licensed version of Tableau connects to dozens of data
sources.
The public version has a smaller list, but two of the more
popular spreadsheet programs Microsoft, Excel and google
sheets are compatible with the free version.
I included an Excel sheet in your course, downloads that has
the column headers and an example for all of the next
three pages, we will be going over.
You do not have to use them to build an interactive resume,
but it may make things easier to follow along in this course.
If you have not already, go ahead and download it and open it
on this first sheet titled education slash work.
We will be putting the time bound elements into the sheet.
I find that adding an order column can be really helpful when
working in Tableau.
you don't have to and the system can count things on its own.
You will see the usefulness of this.
When we head over to Tableau in the next few videos
to begin constructing the resume.
In the next column, use a simple descriptor of what kind
of data this is on this tab.
I'm showing work, history and education, so I used work
and education, making sure that everything I enter
for the rest of the sheet can fit in one of these categories.
Next organization is the name of the place I either worked
or took classes.
Title would be the name of the degree granted or the title
of position that I held that the start and end dates of each
of these goes into the next column.
Finally, a brief summary of your notable highlights would go
over here than the last column.
Um This is what will show up when you hover over parts
of your resume, so make sure that this is accurate and spell
check again.
If you have your resume or your linkedin profile handy.
This can be much easier.
Um as you're just copying and pasting the information that
you already have gathered on the next tab skills, You
will begin to categorize your skills at the end of the day,
much of this will rely on your own opinion of where your
skills are in comparison to others you want to do yourself
and your work justice.
But if you overplay a skill, you will ultimately attract
the wrong employees, employers and will eventually end up
frustrated.
So choose wisely in the first column, we're gonna type
the name of the skill and if you're having a hard time coming
up with it, then linkedin is going to be your best friend.
Let me show you if your current profile doesn't have the best
name or you're wondering what skills you should have, you
could pull up a job opening on linkedin for a role you
would be interested in.
So if we were to type in here data analyst in jobs And then
we maybe want to pick one.
So senior marketing data analyst, mm hmm.
And you can use kind of the required skills section.
Um, that is in most advertisements to name the job skills
employers are looking for for the role you want to fill.
So we see here sequel or SQL Excel Access and Statistical
skills.
Great. You probably want to look at three or more to make
sure that the skills and employer are listening aren't unique
to that specific role.
Um, you would not want to have to redo your tableau resume
for every job you apply for.
So let's head back over to our spreadsheet.
So you're gonna list all of the skills you think you
should have.
Um, I think you should show in column a from here, we're
gonna move in kind of a non sequential order, skip over here
to column F.
Here, you will decide who is validating the skill.
Be careful because if you list linkedin for an example,
employers may seek to verify this.
In this case, the verification on linkedin would be
the endorsements you get for your skills.
If you're listing self, well that's self explanatory, you
may think the easy way around this is to list everything
itself and you certainly could do that.
However, it doesn't make for a very interesting presentation
and may lead to a credibility gap.
If an employer can't verify the skill once you've decided
which category your skills fall into.
For column F.
You can come over here to column C, which is level name here,
you will list what level you feel that skill is that you
can use your own assortment of qualifiers and some may be
industry specific.
I choose strong, capable and learning because I felt
they gave an honest depiction that was not negative
and showed my willingness to continue to grow.
So in this column you will give your skill level, a verbal
descriptor.
We can work on columns B and E.
At the same time in column B, right in the skill level
you feel you have reached at this point numerically again,
be fair to yourself, but make sure that what you put down,
you can justify.
If asked in column E.
You will put the maximum level you feel can be achieved.
So if you think you've mastered a skill and have little left
to learn but there may be something left then four out
of five may be appropriate.
If you think the scale should be broader then you could go
with an eight out of 10 to show the scope of the linkedin
votes then pushing the far end out to the maximum amount that
I had received so far made the most sense to me.
You could also have different scales for different skills.
Finally you can put the first use date in the column.
D. If you have if you have support to list the month then go
for that.
But if you don't feel comfortable then just the year is fine
as well.
You the next sheet is much easier to manage simply list
the links that you will want to use on this page.
Um You won't use them in the same way as the other data
but having them here handy will save you a lot of time.
So you would put for example your linkedin link here.
If you have a website that link would go out there um
If you're applying to position with Coursera for example
or you would want people to see your coursera courses that
you've completed or taught, you would list those links there.
Alright we are all done with this part.
Don't put your resume away just yet.
We will need it for some more information that will be coming
up in a few steps.
See you there.
