Hello, and welcome to this project, prompt engineering with GPT: programming for custom content. My name is Rudi. I'm a full-stack developer and a DevOps engineer and I'm going to be your instructor today for this project. So exactly what are we working on today? Well, we have an outcome. By the end of this project, you're going to be able to apply advanced prompt engineering principles within the Python application in order to be able to generate rich dynamic custom content on any topic with OpenAI's GPT. In order to actually achieve this, we've got three main learning objectives to cover. First of all, we're going to recognize the effects of poorly designed prompts when generating custom content. Secondly, we're going to be utilizing expertly designed prompts to be able to create a quiz based on any specific topic that represents the exact format, level grading, details, and exactly the style that we actually want to get out of that. And thirdly, we're going to go and put this all together in a Python program that dynamically generates detailed custom content based on any topic and topic-related parameters. We're going to be working around the specific scenario for this project, when you take on the role of a software developer at an innovative Ed Tech startup, EduFlex. EduFlex is trying to enrich the learning experience of Python programming students. They've identified the need for an AI-driven dynamic quiz generator so they can quickly personalize quizzes for their students based on any given user input, like topic, number of questions, and potential answers. So you've been brought on as the new developer EduFlex, your task is to go ahead and leverage OpenAI's GPT-3 model to build a dynamic Python program capable of generating a multiple choice quiz on any chosen topic. We're going to be using an in-depth understanding of prompt engineering principles, Python programming, as well as familiarity with OpenAI's GPTs parameters. The program itself is vital for EduFlex's mission to be able to provide interactive and personalized learning experiences. And so by reducing the manual work for content creators and increasing student engagement, your program will provide a significant competitive advantage for the firm within the bustling Ed Tech sector. In order to get on well with this project, you're going to need some basic Python programming skills; functions, assignments, variables, for example, some experience of working with APIs, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks installed. I've left some resources here if you haven't got Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed. You can go ahead and get that installed either on Mac OS or Windows 10. You'll also need the credit cards for tokens. The cost of the tokens for this particular projects will not be high. We're talking in the cents rather than dollars. You may be able to claim some free tokens as a trial if you haven't used the GPT API before. If you haven't used the Rime interface before, keep in mind that this is an interactive project, so you're encouraged to pause the video regularly to follow along. Utilize the features such as the rewind, skipping backwards and forwards through tasks in order to ensure that you're able to drill and practice as many of the concepts that we cover here today as much as possible. This is a great way to ensure that the knowledge that you've gained here is solidified for you. So pause a lot and practice away. Let's get started. The first thing we actually need to do is to set up our API in the Python scripts, but before we do that, we've got to go ahead and set up billing for GPT's API access. So let's go ahead and do that now. I want you to go ahead and open up a new browser. I'm using Chrome here. I want you to go ahead and search for Open AI API.

Hit "Enter." Then we're going to go and navigate to openai.com here. Once you've come to this page, if you already have an account, you can go ahead and log in. If you haven't, you're going to click on sign up. You can go ahead and sign up with your own e-mail address by clicking in this box, then continue. Or you can go ahead and use an OATH method and sign up with one of your other accounts. I'm going to go ahead and use my Google account. When you've signed in, you might be brought to this landing page here. We're going to go ahead and click on API. Otherwise, you might be brought to the actual dashboard page here, which is the right place we need to be in. The first thing we're going to do is click on this Personal tab up here. We're going to go down to manage accounts. Inside of here, we're going to go to the left pane over here and click on "Billing" and then we're going to click on "Set up paid accounts." Then we're going to click on "I'm an individual." What you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and enter in your credit card details here and you're going to click on "Set up payment method." Once you've gone ahead and set up your paid account, the next thing we need to do is to go ahead and generate a new API key. So you're going to click on "API keys" here on the left pane. Then you're going to go ahead and click on "Create new secret key", give it a name, Create secret key, and then go ahead and copy this. This is obviously only going to be available once. Once you actually close this window, you won't be able to see it again, so you can go ahead and store it somewhere safely. For this purpose, I'm going to click "Copy", which is this button here on the right with the squares and then we're going to click "Done." We're now ready to go and boot up Jupyter Notebook and get our application started. Let's go ahead and install the libraries that we need to install for our projects and get our API key configured. We're going to open up a new terminal window and we're going to type in Jupyter Notebook.

From here on the right-hand side, we're going to go ahead and click on the New button and we're going to open up a new notebook with Python. I've got Python 3 installed here. Whatever Python program you've got, you're going to go ahead and click on that. Awesome. Now we have a new Jupyter Notebook. First thing we need to do is to install the libraries that we need for our projects. So to do that, we'll do exclamation mark, I'm going to type pip install openai. Hit "Enter." We going to do exclamation mark again, we're going to do pip install os. Your distribution of Python might already have OS installed inside of it. You'll get a message coming out in your output once we actually run this program to let us know if that's actually being installed or if that's already installed. Next thing we're going to do is to hit "Enter" twice and we're going to import our Open AI and OS. We're going to do import openai. Next line, imports os. Now that we've got all libraries in place, we can securely configure the Open AI API. On a new line, we're just going to type in here os.environ, square bracket. We're going to open a string here and we're going to say API_KEY in all caps. We're going to open a new string here after the equals sign and we're going to go ahead and paste in our new API key. That's going to go and install the API key that we have to this environment variable, API_KEY. Now we can go ahead and save that against API key on the open API library. We do that by openai.api_key

and we just make that equal to os.getenv,

open rounded brackets, and then we're going to do a string here of API_KEY the way that we've actually set it up on the line above. And just to test that that's actually right, we need to do a print statement down here. We're going to say print, inside rounded brackets we'll do openai.api_key.

Once we've done that, we're going to click on the Kernel button here. We're going to do restart and run all. Then we're going to click on the button here, "Restart and run all cells."

And see here we've got command not found pip. So in this case, because I'm using pip3, I may have to actually append pip with pip 3. You may need to do the same, restart and run all. We can see here requirements already satisfied, some notices. And at the bottom here we can see that it's actually successfully stored our API key against openai.api_key. We are now ready to go ahead and use Open AI's API for our own uses. So there we have it. We've gone ahead and set up billing for GPT API access, we configured our API in a Python script. And obviously setting up this connection is going to lay the foundation for our quiz generate project as it enables communication between the Python script and OpenAI service. Good work. I'll see you on the next task. We're going to go ahead and write our first prompts and get our first response from GPT's API for our exam-generation questions. Look forward to seeing you then
