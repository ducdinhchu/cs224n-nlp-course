Welcome back. On the previous task, we defined the chatbot conversation function. In this task, we will handle frequently asked questions. We will customize the chatbot to effectively respond to common frequently asked questions related to e-commerce customer service platform. Let's now go to our Colab file again and see the frequently asked questions and how can we handle them.

Here we will go through three code blocks. The first one is about handling FAQs for product information.

We will define the product_information_faq function,

which is a function that handles frequently asked questions about the products and the information that's relevant to the products. Here we can define some product keywords and the user input. For example, some product keywords can be

product, item, details, features, specifications. We can add more words, for example, capabilities. Feel free to add more words based on your needs or interest. Now, as you can see here, we are providing the relevant product information based on the user's query. Please specify the product you are interested in and I'll provide more details. Then the user can enter the product name. After that, the product name is used to retrieve and display the product information from a database or the API as you can see here. Then the product details will be displayed with their features and their specifications. Let's run this code block. Then moving on to the second one where we are handling FAQs for shipping and returns. The same logic is going on here. For the shipping keywords, let's say, for example, the end users want to ask for shipping products. They can use shipping keywords like, for example, shipping, delivery, courier, and timeline. There are returns keywords that are related to the shipping keyword which are return, refund, exchange, and policy. Here, feel free to add more words based on your needs. The same logic happening here, same as the previous code block. Providing relevant shipping information based on the user's query and then displaying the shipping options, then providing relevant returns and displaying the returns. Let's execute this code block. Then let's move on to handling FAQs for customer support. The same logic here for the support keywords. As you know that to identify the customer support and the user input, there are commonly used keywords like, for example, help, issue, problem, assistance, even we can use support, for example, or any other relevant words. Here, the same logic, providing relevant customer support assistance." Please describe your issue or problem in detail so we can assist you." Then the user will describe the issue and then the model or the chatbot will respond back, "We are here to help. Please provide more details about your issue or problem." Great. This is how we handle frequently asked questions for customer support. Let's run the cell, and it's perfectly working. We have just handled FAQs for product information, for shipping and returns, and for customer support. Note that you can add more code blocks for other relevant topics that you might find helpful and useful other than the three topics that we covered here. Great. That's it for this task. In the next task, we will initiate chatbot conversation and test it. See you then.
