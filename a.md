Welcome back in this chapter.
We are going to create a plot for the average trip duration,
and we want that information for our user type.
So we have a dimension called user type, and we have
a measure called trip Duration.
So that's all we really need to use.
Let's click on this blank new worksheet and double click
on it and call it trip duration.
It's time to change the title.
Do average trip duration and align it.
Keep it in the center.
Now we want the trip duration for different user tax, so all
they really need to do is drag the user Type two columns
and the trip duration measure two rows by the fort.
If the Rose shows you that it's looking at the sum
of preparation, then you can just click on this and go
to measure and change it from some to average.
And now it shows you that the average trip duration
for the user type customer is 4839 An average trip duration
for a user type subscriber is 714 Now we can use
another dimension to see how the distribution of these
two categories might be so we can look at gender.
And if I drag and drop this gender, the dimension on color.
So let's drag and drop this on color.
You will see that we get a legend on the right side.
It's 01 and 20 is for unspecified gender.
One is for male and two is for female.
And now we can see on our previous plot that the distribution
across genders is much more even for our subscribers.
But not so even in our customers user time, which
is dominated by male customers as far as the average
population is concerned.
Great. Now we can do something similar for our start station
and end stations.
Let's go to end stations and what we want to do is maybe use
different colors for these different stations.
And the intensity of the color might be different
for different values of how many times those stations were
the end stations for how many trips.
And we already know that the number of records gives us
the count count of the rose so we can simply drag and drop
this to color.
That will add a legend, and it will show you different color
for different station because different stations have
different values of number of records and the higher value is
darker.
We can do the same thing for our start stations as well.
So again we'll drag and drop the number of records want
to color.
And that will add the legend as well as if, uh, change
the color for all the different plots.
All right, great.
So now that we added the end station data, the start station
data, let's take a look at the most popular start stations
with most common end stations.
Just like we categorized and looked at the distribution
of average tribulation across customer and subscribers.
And look at the distribution across gender.
Well, basically do the same thing for our start stations
and stations.
Let's do that in the next chapter.
