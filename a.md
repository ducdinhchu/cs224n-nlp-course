Welcome back Tableau is probably the most popular data
analysis tool for businesses at the moment.
And there are a lot of reasons for that, including that it
can handle large amounts of data very easily.
We will see this today because the data set that
we're using is a text file with which is actually larger
than 1 50 MB.
That's quite quite big for a text file.
It has excellent features for data, visualization
and analysis, and this is very easy to use, and it's very
intuitive.
Uh, in addition to that tableau has seen incredible growth
in industry adoption, and it has been improving constantly.
You can connect almost any kind of data source with tableau.
Our data is in a CSP file, so that's basically a text fire,
and you can click on the text file button right here.
And the fire that we want to use is on desktop inside the
data folder.
So you see this file called City by Trip data dot C S V.
Just open this now, this is a fairly large fire, and you
can click on the update now, Button two, have tableau,
upload all the data and show you in all these different
columns, right?
And you can, of course, uh, import a bunch of different type
types of files.
Uh, like Microsoft Excel files are from a database server.
You know, there's a lot of options.
You'll notice that we have different types of data for all
of these columns.
This hash sign is basically for numbers, and then we might
also have dates.
So this is for a bit, and you can change these data types
as well.
So you can click here and you can click on the data type
and you can actually change them.
And then this is again number, and then you have string
as well.
So you have numbers, dates, strength, brilliance, and so on.
Once you have input imported, the file tableau will show you
the data in this kind of tabular format, which is similar
to how you would expect this in same Microsoft exa
or a similar software.
And as we just saw, a tableau automatically detects the data
types for various columns and most of the times that will get
it right.
And again, If you want to change it, you can change the data
type right Once the data is imported, you can go to sheet.
The first ship will be blank right now, so just click on this
and in sheets you can create different kind of, uh,
visualizations and different kind of plots and graphs.
So we're going to use the first sheet to create, uh, a plot
where we'll see geo locations on a world map.
And in this case, that map is going to be in New York City
because that's where the data is from.
So on the left side, you will see measures and dimensions.
Dimensions are typically categorical data like you might have
user type or birth year, our end station name.
So these are all categorical data, and measures are going
to be a numerical data which can be added, averaged
and can be used to compute other features.
So bike I'd station idea all numerical data, so that's why
it shows them in measures.
Sometimes you might have measures, or at least data which
tabular detects as measures which you might actually want
to use as categorical data.
So that's very easy to fix.
In our case, we have gender, and in this data, the gender has
three values to it.
It could be zero for undefined.
It could be one for male, and it would be too for female.
So these are numbers, but we know that this is in fact,
a categorical data and not not measures.
So you can simply click on this and then drag it and place it
in the dimensions area in that it will simply add that
two dimensions and remove it from measures.
Great. So now that we know how to import data in tableau
and how that data will look like in your data source
in a tabular format as well as when you go to a sheet, you
will see that data in distributed as measures and dimensions.
So now that we know how that data looks like, we are going
to start creating our plots are our grass.
