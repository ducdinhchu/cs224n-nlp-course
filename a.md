Welcome back. In the previous task, we learned how to handle frequently asked questions. In this task, we will Initiate Chatbot Conversation and Testing. So we will start live conversations with the chatbot and conduct tests through prompts and through responses from the chatbot to evaluate its performance and response accuracy. So the task objective is to build and test a customer service chatbot and to execute and monitor live chatbot interactions. And conduct practical testing and debugging through prompting and getting responses from the chatbot. And through iterating through the prompts while chatting with the chatbot, and also to assess the chatbot's conversation capabilities. So let's go to the collab file. As you see here in Task 5, we will initiate the chatbot conversation and testing. So first of all, we are starting a conversation with a welcome message from the chatbot. Then there is a continuous interaction between the user and the chatbot. And here, if the user typed buy or quit and feel free to add more words or to customize the goodbye words, then the chatbot will say, thank you for using our chatbot, have a great day. Constructing the prompt for the ChatGPT API where we access the ChatGPT model using the API and then sending the user input and the current prompt to the ChatGPT API and receiving response. As we did previously, we are using the same model, the same temperature and the maximum token limit. And here, as you can see, the extract and display ChatGPT's response. And you will see that in the chat when we execute the code, how the model will respond back to the user and at last updated the prompt for the next iteration because there will be a continuous chat between the end user and the model. So when the model responds back to the user, the user will send another prompt to the model through the chat and iterate with the prompts. Let's now execute this code cell. So as you can see here, a new window is opened with a welcome message from the chatbot. So welcome to our customer service chatbot. How can I help you today?

Now we will chat generally with the chatbot because the chatbot is not yet customized in a specific domain or for specific products. Let's say I have a problem with delivered products.

See the response I apologize for the inconvenience. Please provide details about the problem. Let's follow up with another prompt. So the products has expired last month and I received them few days ago. So as you can see that I apologize for the delay and the expired products. The model can understand that there is a delay because the product has expired from a month and the user received them from a few days. We take product quality and freshness very seriously. Can you please provide us with the order information? So here the model is following up with the end user, which is really perfect and nice actually. We can add more details about the product or the order information. Let's say I have another issue with other products as well. You will see that the model will keep responding back. Thank you. Welcome, is there anything else I can help you with? Nothing else. Bye and thank you for using our chatbot. Have a great day. That's it for this task. In this task, we initiated the chatbot conversation and tested on it. And again, note that our chatbot is not yet customized for a specific products or services. But it's really performing well based on the conversation that we destined the chatbot on, how we can build a customized chatbot and chat with it. See you then.
