Welcome to this guided project, creating an interactive graph
with tableau public.
Hello, I'm Abby, your instructor for this project.
I'm a designer who specializes in learning and instruction.
In my work as an instructional designer and trainer.
I used data visualizations to make data more meaningful toe
learners.
This could mean adding color or graphics to change a basic
chart into something impactful and memorable to readers of my
work. In this project, I'll guide you through the creation
of an interactive graph using basic data, visualization
principles and the open source tableau public software.
You'll come away with a sample of how to use graphics to tell
a story about your data.
Data Visualization involves the process of representing data
graphically.
In this process, we can use color, shape, size and graphics
to communicate relationships among data.
This allows us to use visual concepts to describe
and illustrate a story about numerical relationships.
To get started, we'll need to install tableau public
by navigating to public dot tableau dot com.
Once we're at this page, you'll wanna look for the download
now link at the bottom of the page.
You'll need to have an email address entered and then click
download the app.
This will initiate an execute herbal file.
So once you've downloaded and executed the file, we will have
Yes. Just run that tableau.
Public file double click on it to open.
Yeah. Now we're ready to move on to the next task.
So in this task, you learned about the purpose of tableaux
and how to access the free tableau account.
In the next task, you'll learn about how to connect your data
to your tableau public account.
