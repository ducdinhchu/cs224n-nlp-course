Hi. Welcome to Coursera.
My name is Maria and I will be your instructor throughout
'Create a Story in Tableau Public" guided project.
This project is for anyone who wants to get hands-on
experience with the public version of Tableau business
intelligence software.
and learn how to create charts and dashboards to tell a story
using data. In this project, each task builds upon another. 
So, by the end of the project, you will be able to create line
charts, treemap and packed bubbles chart.
You will also create several dashboards and 
put a story together.
They're two prerequisites for this project.
You should be familiar with Tableau Public software and have
Tableau Public account.
Other than that, you will be provided with everything you
need to successfully complete the project. 
Before we begin I also want to briefly introduce myself.
I am a certified project manager and 
CompTIA Project+ instructor.
I have been working as a project manager in different
industries for about seven years, and I've also taught the
foundations of project management to corporate employees.
And now I'm going to show you how you can leverage your
skills and knowledge of Tableau Public to create stories and
show your data insights to the wider audience.
Without further ado, let's begin!
