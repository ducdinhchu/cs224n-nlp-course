Welcome back now that we have created all the sheets that
we wanted.
Now it's time to put everything together in one visualization,
which can actually be shared with other people.
So in order to do that, well, let me just correct the title
here we will create instead of creating a new sheep.
This time we will create a new dashboard.
So take on this button and let's give this a name by double
clicking on it.
So this is for for 2018, and by the fourth, the size
of this dashboard might not be set to automatic.
So click here, click on the range and set it to automatic.
This way, the dashboard cameras will align itself
to the space that you have available on that particular
screen.
And now all we really need to do is just check on these, uh,
and add them to your dashboard, either by double clicking
on these sheets or by dragging and dropping them here.
So start by that.
Just double click on this.
So this is the most popular end stations on a map.
Double click on the stock stations, so most popular end
stations and start stations both are added.
The legend is also shown here.
Let's click on the trip duration, So double click on this.
So this shows you the average trip duration and for customers
and subscribers.
And you also have distribution across gender that you can see
with the help of these colors.
Double click on the start popular sheep.
So these are the most popular start stations, and we are also
displaying the end stations on this plot and then double
click on the start time in the booklet on the end time.
Now, you may or may not like the default configuration so you
can drag and drop any of these plots anywhere.
And, uh, you know, make it work for you.
So what I want is this is fine, but I think the a start time,
I'm going to drag and drop it somewhere here, and I'll do
the same thing for the end time for different user types.
So, uh, dragon, drop it here.
Yeah, actually, I drag and drop it here, and let's also drag
and decrease the size of these maps, So just click here
and decrease the science and take care and decrease
the science.
And let's actually decrease the size of these maps a little
more. So I'll take the end time for user types on the right
side. Yes, this is fine.
And I'll take the most popular start stations at this
starting something like this.
And maybe I can now bring this end time for user types here.
That department.
All right, so this is this looks fine.
We can reduce the size of average population.
Okay? And you'd notice that tableau automatically adds all
the religions as well.
The great.
That's pretty much all you need to know to create a dashboard
for our city bike database.
A data set.
And now, if you want to save this, you will have to publish
it because we're using type of public.
And once you do that, let's say I go fire and say to tap
the public.
Then it will ask you to log into your tableau account,
and your visualization will be published to that account.
Right? Otherwise, you will not be able to save it locally.
Great. So I hope this gives you some insight into using
tableau for data visualization, and there is a bunch
of different things, and that's possible with tableau.
It's extremely intuitive and extremely easy to use to get
some data analysis and, uh, to get some insights out of your
data, and hopefully this will help you achieve
some meaningful results with your own data sets.
Thank you for participating.
