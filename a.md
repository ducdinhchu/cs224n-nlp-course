Welcome back.
In the previous task, we learned how to connect to a data
source and clean up data using the data interpreter,
and created to line charts.
In this task, we're going to create a packed bubbles chart
and a treemap.
But before we begin, I want you to rename the sheets that
we had created in the previous task and save you work
to Tableau Public.
Feel free to pause the video right now to complete this part
of the task. Once you're done, resume the video. 
Alight, so let's begin by adding 
a new sheet to the workbook and renaming it
to 'countries'.
Next, select 'Entrants' from measures and drop it
onto the columns.
Then select 'Finishers' and drop it onto the rows.
Next, select 'Winners' nationality' from dimensions and
drop it onto the view. Then click on 'Show me' and select
'packed bubbles' chart.
Now let's switch 'SUM(Finishers)' date pill 
from color to detail, and 
add 'Winners' Nationality'
to the color marks card.
Okay, this looks good.
One more thing.
Let's remove 'Results Voided' from the view. 
Right click on the bubble and then select 'exclude'.
Feel free to pause the video right now to complete this part
of the task.
Alright. In the second part of this task we are going
to create a treemap.
So let's add another sheet to the workbook and rename it
tho 'Winners'.
Next, select 'Winners' from the dimensions pane and drop it
onto the columns shelf, and then select 'Winners'.
average speed' from the measures and drop it onto the rows.
Then click on 'Show me' and select 'Treemap' chart.
Okay, now let's right click
on the voided results, select 'exclude', and select 'Winners'
Nationality' and drop it onto the color.
One last thing.
Let's change SUM(Winners' Average Speed)
to
attribute.
Now, when I hover over a place in the treemap,
I can actually see winners' nationality, name and average speed.
Feel free to pause the video right now to complete this part
of the task. Once you are done, resume the video.
 Good to have you back.
So let's summarize what we've learned in this task.
In this task, we've created a packed bubble chart
and a treemap, and we've also practiced adding data pills
to the Marks Card. In the next task, we're going
to create dashboards for each of these charts.
See in the next task!
